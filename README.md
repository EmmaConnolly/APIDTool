APIDTool, or "Fix blank Ancestry.com citations," is a third-party addon for the genealogy application Gramps.

If you've ever imported a GEDCOM file from Ancestry.com into Gramps, you may have noticed a lot of blank sources and citations, with nothing to distinguish them but the "_APID" attribute. The APIDTool fills in blank source titles and citations with the _APID, so that they can more easily be distinguished, edited, and merged.

For best results, use immediately after importing a GEDCOM file downloaded from Ancestry.com, without previously running the "Merge citations" tool.

This is a very new tool and may have bugs. Functionality may be added or changed in the near future. To install, download a .zip file of the repository and unzip in your gramps60/plugins directory. This tool will not work with any version of GRAMPS older than 6.0.
